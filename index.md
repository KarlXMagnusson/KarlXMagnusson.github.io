## R&D PROJECTS (5 years old, due to NDAs)
---

**Jan. 2016 – Dec. 2019**	&middot; **EU projects: Safepower, EU FP7 EMC2 , Contrex, ITEA3 Panorama**

EU-level projects with 5-100 academic & industrial partners. 
R&D in reference architectures, design tools for low-power mixed criticality adaptable embedded systems applied in for railway, automotive and avionics industries.	
		
**Nov. 2017 – 2020**	&middot; **National project: CORRECT by construction design methodology**

I researched correct-by-construction design methodology for future avionics applications.	
		
**Jan. 2016 – Dec. 2018**	&middot; **Scalable Multi-Processor System-on-Chip Platform over Ethernet**

I developed a Zynq-7000 MPSoC based fog computing node with emphasis on dynamic service reallocation, and process off-loading on the FPGA fabric using network-on-chip communication.

**Jan. 2015 – Jun. 2016**	&middot; **Single Event Upset Detector Experiment for KTH MiST Satellite Project**

The project aimed to demonstrate a proof of concept for a low-cost computer system suitable for low-earth orbit space applications by using self-healing and fault-tolerance design techniques. I designed several intellectual property blocks in VHDL using Vivado design suite necessary for the operation of the system.


**Feb. 2014 – Aug. 2014**	&middot; **Firmware Development for VHF Radio Transceiver**

I was responsible for the embedded software design using Hybrid of TI-RTOS and IAR VisualState to create a low size scalable and real-time system on A9 core of the TI OMAP-L138 for VHF Radio Transceivers.

**Sep. 2012 – May 2013**	&middot; **MEMS Accelerometer Design for Hydrocarbon Microctremor Analaysis**

I investigated a low noise single axis accelerometer design with the objective of maximizing its sensitivity to low frequency (0.1-100Hz) micro-tremor signals believed to correlate to hydrocarbon reserves. The work ended by providing initial architecture and design parameters.

**Apr. 2012 – Jun. 2012**	&middot; **Test Automation for User Interfaces of Commercial Web and Desktop Applications**

I developed test suites with over 1500 test cases using Microsoft test management and implemented the work using Microsoft visual studio with C# and ‘White’ libraries.

**Jan. 2010 – Jan. 2012**	&middot; **Resistive Open Faults Analysis in Low-power Digital Integrated Circuits**

I researched the impact of specific class of manufacturing faults called resistive opens in interconnects and vias of electronic integrated circuits that use dynamic volkarl and frequency scaling. I developed a model for the fault behaviour and analysed its impact on testing.

**May. 2013 – Jan. 2014**	&middot; **Design Specification for single phase energy meter for national utility company**

I researched and developed new diagnosis and repair methods of faulty energy meters to significantly enhance (80%) the recovery of energy meters at the country-level and saving thousands of hard currency monthly (Sudan).
I researched and developed a new 240-VAC energy metering solution. The work yielded a product passing international standards and at the initial skarls of mass manufacturing. The significance of the work is the first success for developing a product from scratch of this kind locally.

**Jan. 2008 – Jun. 2008**	&middot; **Robotic Design for Asia-Pacific College Robot Contest, (Theme: गोपाल/Govinda)**

I was a team lead of the electronic design and programming for one of the university’s robotic contest (Petronas university). My university team won prizes for the design in the national competition in Malaysia.

**Jun. 2008 – Dec. 2008**	&middot; **Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd, Trainee**
Trainee in Preventive and Corrective Maintenance of Plant Processing Instruments. The assignment took place within the subscidiary White Nile (5B) Petroleum Operating Company in central processing plant facilities. I was part of instrumentation team tasked with preventive and corrective maintenance of flow, pressure, level & temperature instruments. I inspected several Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&ID) for the plant and part of the field operation daily discussions.
